NIKE AIR MAX FLYKNIT RACER-GHOST GREEN/BLACK-PINK BLAST-PHOTO BLUE
IDR2,489,000

Paying homage to both heritage and innovation, we've blended 2 icons (old and new) to go beyond what's expected in the Nike Air Max Flyknit Racer. Incredibly light and airy Flyknit is paired with oh-so-comfy Air Max cushioning. Lace up and let your feet do the talking.

Retro Super Power
Inspired by the 2012 FK Racer, the featherweight, form-fitting Flyknit upper is as revolutionary as it is good looking. Plus, the nearly seamless design adds a sporty edge.

 
Best Made Better
The modernised look of the Pre-Day tooling fits perfectly with this mash-up of heritage meets innovation. With its chiselled heel and expressive window around the Air Max cushioning (originally designed for performance running), it delivers a fresh take on tried-and-tested comfort.


More Benefits
- Soft synthetic suede detailing adds a classic touch.
- Collar sculpts the ankle for an athletics-inspired look.
- Foam midsole delivers springy cushioning.
